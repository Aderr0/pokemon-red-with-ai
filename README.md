# Pokemon RED play by an AI

According to [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnredblue), in the Any % Glitchless with Classic route (let's make it easier first), the world record of Pokemon Red is 1h 55min 56s by pokeguy. As Pokemon is also made of random interaction, the player have always choices to do. Based on this, I thought it was possible to create an AI that can beat this world record.
